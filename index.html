			<h2><b>About Me</b></h2>
			
			<p>While I am new to the coding world, I am super excited to learn and grow as a Software Engineer. I am a team player and I believe that working with fellow coders will only help further my knowledge base. Outside of learning to become a fantastic software engineer, I love UGA Football! GO DAWGS! I am a lover of all things that can be read. I do not discriminate against genre or types of literature. My top 3 favorite book series are as follows:</p>
			
			<ol> <!--Utilized an ordered list for my favorite books.-->
				
				<li>The Wheel of Time Series by Robert Jordan</li>
				
				<li>The Crave Series by Tracy Wolf (Much better than Twilight)</li>
				
				<li>The Mortal Instruments Series, The Infernal Devices Series, and The Dark Artifices Series....ALL by Cassandra Clare</li>
